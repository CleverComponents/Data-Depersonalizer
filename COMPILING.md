# Compiling notes

The current version of Data Depersonalizer needs for the non-free library
Clever Internet.NET Suite. This is a drawback, and we suggest the task of
changing the program so that it does the same job without the non-free library.
Anyone who thinks of doing substantial further work on the program,
first may free it from dependence on the non-free library.
